Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites. This project focuses on scraping a webpage that lists the largest companies in India for the year 2023. The script fetches this data, cleans it, and presents it in the form of a structured table using pandas DataFrame.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
pip (Python package installer)

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code:  git clone https://github.com/riyazahmed2005/web-scrap.git
-> cd web-scrap

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r industries_data.py
Usage
Navigate to the project directory where scrape_companies.py is located.

Run the Python script scrape_companies.py:

bash
Copy code
python scrape_companies.py
The script will connect to the webpage, scrape the data about the largest companies in India for 2023, and display it in the terminal.

Optionally, modify the script to save the data to a file (e.g., CSV or Excel) or integrate it with other systems as needed.
