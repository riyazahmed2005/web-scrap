Web Scraping Project: Largest Companies in India (2023)

This project demonstrates a Python script (industry_data.py) for web scraping to retrieve data about the largest companies in India for the year 2023 from the Wikipedia page "List of largest companies in India". The script utilizes Python libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas for fetching, parsing, and saving the data into a CSV file (industry.csv).

Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites. This project focuses on scraping the Wikipedia page that lists the largest companies in India for the year 2023. The script (industry_data.py) fetches this data, cleans it, and saves it into a structured CSV file (industry.csv) using pandas DataFrame.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/riyazahmed2005/web-scrap.git
cd web-scrap
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Navigate to the project directory where industry_data.py is located.

Run the Python script industry_data.py:

bash
Copy code
python industry_data.py
The script will connect to the Wikipedia page, scrape the data about the largest companies in India for 2023, clean it, and save it to industry.csv.

Optionally, open industry.csv to view the scraped data in a structured format.

Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:

industry_data.py: Python script for web scraping.
